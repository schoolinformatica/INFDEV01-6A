\section{Practicum assignments}
	In this section the practicum assignments and their grading criteria are listed.
	
	\paragraph{Assignment 1}
		The student is asked to implement a simple database for the management of the characters of a hypothetical Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) in Postgres given the specifications and the relational schema. Besides the student must implement an application that allows the user to subscribe to the game by specifying the user profile data, and execute the operations in the specifications on both his user account and the owned characters in the game.

	\paragraph{Assignment 2}
		The student is asked to build indices over tables in the Postgres definition of the database for the given schema to optimize the performance of significant queries, and motivate his choices in a written report by analysing performance issues with those queries according to what explained in the theoretical classes.

	\paragraph{Assignment 3}
		The student must implement a multi-thread version of assignment 1, where the program simulates multiple user starting different transactions to log in to their account and start a game session. The student should write a report about possible conflicts arising from different concurrent transactions trying to access server data.

	\paragraph{Assignment 4}
		Given a database specification, the student is asked to realise a correspondent graph database model, and implement it in graph DBMS Neo4j. The user application should be able to interface to the database in Neo4j and implement the same functionalities as in Assignment 1.
